### Step 1: Create the Database

First, log into MySQL:

```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

Then create the database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ProcessListerDB;
```

### Step 2: Create Tables

**1. Tenants Table**

```sql
USE ProcessListerDB;

CREATE TABLE Tenants (
    TenantID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    TenantName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    TenantDescription TEXT
);
```

**2. Users Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    TenantID INT,
    Username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    PasswordHash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(255),
    Role VARCHAR(100),
    FOREIGN KEY (TenantID) REFERENCES Tenants(TenantID)
);
```

**3. Devices Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Devices (
    DeviceID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    TenantID INT,
    DeviceName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    DeviceDescription TEXT,
    RegistrationDate DATETIME,
    LastActiveDate DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (TenantID) REFERENCES Tenants(TenantID)
);
```

**4. Processes Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Processes (
    ProcessID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    DeviceID INT,
    ProcessName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    ProcessCommand TEXT,
    CPUPercentage DECIMAL(5,2),
    Timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (DeviceID) REFERENCES Devices(DeviceID)
);
```

**5. Device_Process_Link Table** (If needed for many-to-many relationships)

```sql
CREATE TABLE Device_Process_Link (
    DeviceID INT,
    ProcessID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DeviceID) REFERENCES Devices(DeviceID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ProcessID) REFERENCES Processes(ProcessID),
    PRIMARY KEY (DeviceID, ProcessID)
);
```

### Step 3: Implement Access Control and Data Retention Policy

**Access Control:**

For row-level security, you might need to implement custom application logic, as MySQL does not support row-level security as some other RDBMS like PostgreSQL do. Ensure all your queries include the `TenantID` where necessary.

**Data Retention Policy:**

Set up a scheduled job (like a cron job) to delete records older than 30 days:

```sql
DELETE FROM Processes WHERE Timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;
```

You would need to automate this script to run periodically.

### Step 4: Test the Setup

- Insert test data into each table.
- Perform test queries to ensure that the relationships and constraints work as expected.
- Check if the data flow from client-side to backend and backend to frontend works as planned.
- Validate security policies and data retention mechanisms.

### Step 5: Maintenance and Monitoring

- Regularly backup your database.
- Monitor performance and optimize queries and indexes as necessary.
- Keep an audit log for user activities and device registrations.

### Conclusion

This setup should align with your database design plan, ensuring data integrity, supporting multi-tenancy, and providing efficient data management and retrieval based on user and tenant permissions. Remember, regular maintenance and monitoring are crucial for the health and security of your database.
